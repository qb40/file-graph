#qb-file-graph

**qb-file-graph** is a dos app to view the byte values of a file as a line graph.
Ever thought how a file looks like when seen as a graph (other than a audio file)?
This is how. Totally random? Or is there a pattern?


##demo

<img src="/assets/img/0.png" width="70%"><br/>
Enter `Filename` whose graph is to be viewed.
<br/>
<br/>


<img src="/assets/img/1.png" width="70%"><br/>
`Point gap` is the distance between 2 points (bytes).
`Time gap` is the delay between drawing of 2 points.
<br/>
<br/>


<img src="/assets/img/2.png" width="70%"><br/>
`graph.bas`'s amplitude graph can be seen.
<br/>
<br/>


<img src="/assets/img/3.png" width="70%"><br/>
Multiple traces are dran one after another.
Press `Enter` to clear old traces.
